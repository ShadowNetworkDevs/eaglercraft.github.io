## About this site

[eaglercraft.github.io](../game) is a website intended to make it easy for people to play eaglercraft online. However, if you cannot access this website due to a firewall (i.e., school firewall), then feel free to download the file from the official [downloads page](https://eaglercraft.com/p/downloads/). For information about hosting a server, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m-IJ83qHDg&t=10s).

## Why this even exists

even though github.io is blocked by many school firewalls, I wanted to provide an option for people who, 1. could not afford real minecraft and 2. don't have enough space on their device for this. But of course, if you can afford a non-pirated copy of minecraft, go to [minecraft.net] (minecraft.net) and blow your money on some block game.

## List of servers

Now, the moment you start eaglercraft, your gonna realize there is NOW a singleplayer option! This means that you may play on a server or singleplayer. However, after checking all of your favorite server ips, you realize that none of them work. Fortunely, you can visit [this site](https://topeaglerservers.com/) to look at some of the servers people have hosted. Here are some of my personal favorites:

wss://play.shadownetwork.shop
wss://nexomc.org
wss://arch.mc

notice how each of these addresses is preceded by wss://. So, unlike a url, you musn't be lazy and not type it out.
